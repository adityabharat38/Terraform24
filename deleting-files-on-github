If you want to delete a file from the repository without removing it from your local file system, you can use the git rm command with the --cached option. This removes the file from version control but keeps it in your local directory.

Remove the file from the repository, keeping it locally:

css
Copy code
git rm --cached file-to-keep-locally.txt
Commit the change:

sql
Copy code
git commit -m "Remove file from repository"
Push the changes to your remote repository:

perl
Copy code
git push origin your-branch-name
